/*
    * A union is a struct in which all members are allocated at the same address so that the 
    union occupies only as muhc space as its largest member

    * Use of unions can be essential for compactness of data and through that for performance.
    (unions are considered overused feature; avoid them when you can)

    A union cannot have virtual functions.
    [2] A union cannot have members of reference type.
    [3] A union cannot have base classes.
    If a union has a member with a user-defined constructor, a copy operation, a move opera-
    tion, or a destructor, then that special function is deleted (ยง3.3.4, ยง17.6.4) for that union;
    that is, it cannot be used for an object of the union type.
    [5] At most one member of a union can have an in-class initializer (ยง17.4.4).
[     6] A union cannot be used as a base class.
